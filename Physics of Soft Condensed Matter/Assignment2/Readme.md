## Assignment 2

Take dcd file -> load into vmd -> save as pdb

Q1. Take (x, y, z) and a small volume (dx dy dz) around and count the number of
atoms traversing this volume for some time. And also find the density (N/volume)
.

INPUT: x, y, z, dx, dy, dz                
OUTPUT: n(x,y,z:t)/(dxdydz) (Plot as a function of time)

Also, calcultate the average of this quantity over time period t.
