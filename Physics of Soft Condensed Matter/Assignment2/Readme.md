## Assignment 2

Take dcd file -> load into vmd -> save as pdb

Q1. Take (x, y, z) and a small volume (dx dy dz) around and count the number of
times the atoms visited this volume. And also find the density (N/volume)
.

INPUT: x, y, z, dx, dy, dz 
OUTPUT: n(x,y,z:t)/(dxdydz) (Plot as a function of time -- FRAMES)

Also, calcultate the average of this quantity over time period t.

Q2. Take two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2), and two volumes (as an input)
. Calculate the number of FRAMES for which both are non-empty (or there is
atleast one atom in both volumes).
